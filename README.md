# codetest
Create and host a ReactJS based form that will accept text and display the text in another element when submitted.  Use TypeScript for your JavaScript code.  Use hooks and effects to manage your state and events.

1)     Free hosting should be available in many places, including AWS S3 (since this will really only need to be a static file client-side app)

2)     If you have the time and can make it work, use Material-UI for your UI components
